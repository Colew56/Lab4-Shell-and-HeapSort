# Lab4-Shell-and-HeapSort
This repository contains 2 sorting methods. The heap-sort script takes 12 input files. These input files contain 25,50,200, and 500 integers arrganged into ascending, decending and random order. The name of the input files will be 25_asc, 25_ran, 25_dec, and will continue this notation for 50,200 and 500. The shell-sort scrip also takes 12 input files and an additional file named ShellInputs, so 13 in total. Once the script is ran, both of the outputs for shell sort and heap sort will be written to the same output file. 

Usage:
First run the shell-sort script. The output from this script will be printed to the files 25_outputcolumns,50_outputcolumns, 200_outputcolumns, and 500_outputcolumns. Additionaly, there will be another output printed to the ShellcomparisonOutput.txt file. The output from this script contains headers for each gap sequence with columns of the sorted data. Additionally there are the run times of each gap sequence at the top.

Once you have reviewed these files, you can run the heapsort script, and it will write to the same output files. There is no need to delete the output from the shell sort script because it should be overwirtten by the heapsort output. The output will have headers, for each input order with columns containing the sorted data. Additionally there are the run time at the top of the file.
